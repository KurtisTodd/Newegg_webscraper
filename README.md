# Newegg_webscraper
Newegg webscraper built to scrape on sale items and store data in a list

The main.py uses a function in order to insert specified web address and specified list as arguments into function parameters. In this way, the 
program Fills up multiple lists for every different video-game option on Newegg.

This process takes a while so I also split up each video-game web address into seperate files.
